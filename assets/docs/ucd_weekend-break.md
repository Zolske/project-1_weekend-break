<img src="../images/doc/project1_weekend-break_site-map.webp" width="600px" height="100%" alt="Navigation menu on desktop and laptops">

#### Type: (Flat) Hierarchical Tree Structure

- quick access
- main nav bar sticky *(enough space, easy navigation)*

<img src="../images/doc/project1_weekend-break_site-map_mobile.webp" width="600px" height="100%" alt="Navigation menu on mobile">

#### Type: Nested List :
- linear path to detail
- reduces complexity

- main navbar **not** sticky *(save space)*

---
## 4. The Skeleton
- visual iconography and these visual conventions *(use of familiar icons & sticking to conventional design)*
    - icons should provide clear meaning, and they should be familiar objects
- The main content areas for each page have the same shape.
- provide consistency, we ensure the same interactions and behaviors appear across our content
- Don't rearrange the order progressive disclosure
- Reveal information over time and across space.
- **"Hick-Hyman"** law
    - the more choices the users has, the longer it will take him to make a decision *(may be he will not decide and leave)*

### **website / company logo :**

The sun, the palm and the beach are symbolic for holidays. They help to convey the meaning of the website. The slogan "You deserve it!" is helping to justify the purchase to the consumer.
